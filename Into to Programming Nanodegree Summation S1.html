				<li>Procedural Thinking: <em>clear and unambiguous instructions</em></li>
				<li>Abstract Thinking: <em>generality amongst seemingly different</em></li>
				<li>Systems Thinking: <em>break big problem into smaller problem</em></li>
				<li>Technological Empathy: <em>understand computer</em></li>
				<li>Debugging:
						<ol>
						<li>Collect evidence</li>
						<li>Generate theories</li>
						<li>Test those theories</li>
						<li>Fix the problem</li>

			<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
			<p>Computers are stupid because they follow given instructions regards if they are correct or incorrect.
			</p>
			<p><b>Information Transfer</b> <em>How the internet works</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			Client <em>to and from</em> Internet <em>to and from</em> Servers
			<br>
			<br>
			<em>to and from = </em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"><dfn><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr></dfn></a> = Hyper Links
			</p>
			<br>
			<b>What is HTML</b><br>
			<dfn><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></dfn> is the standard mark-up language for creating web pages.
				<div>HTML consists of:
					<ul>
						<li>Text Content</li>
						<li>Mark Up</li>
						<li>Ref to Other Documents</li> 
						<li>Links</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			
			HTML uses mark ups to define contents these are called <i>tags</i>, these also help in defining white-space and how that space is viewed.
			<br>
			This is referred to as Mark Up
			<br>
			<p>&lt;<dfn><abbr title="Open Tag">tag name</abbr></dfn>&gt;Contents &lt;<dfn><abbr title="Close tag">/tag name</abbr></dfn>&gt;
			<br>
			<span style="color:crimson;font-weight:bold">This forms an <u>element</u></span>
			</P>
			Element Types = In-line & Block
			<br>
			<br>
			Some examples of tags and their uses:
			<br>
			&lt;a&gt; anchor <u>in-line</u><br>
			&lt;br&gt; line break <u>In-line</u> <em>Void tag requires no close</em>
			<br>
			&lt;p&gt; paragraph <u>Block</u>
			<br>
			&lt;img src=&quot;url&quot; alt = &quot;text&quot;&gt; image tag <u>In-line</u>

			<h3>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web & HTML</h3>
			
			<p>			HTML documents also have additional information<br>
			Most would start with a document type and most would be HTML.<br>
			&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
			This is followed by the head<br>
			This contain meta-data, JavaScript & CSS data.<br>
			This is followed by the body.
			<br>
			This is the viewed part of the HTML
			</p>

			<br>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h3>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>
				<p>The way a page is built is in a logic structure.<br>
					This is much like tree from roots to leaves.where the web page is the root and individual sections grows from that.<br>
					The &lt;div&gt; tag and &lt;table&gt; tag are ways to divide up a page into sections.<br>
					Developer Tools (in browsers) can be used to view code and structure of a HTML document or web page.
				</p>
				<p>
					<dfn><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></dfn> the standard mark-up language used to create web pages.<br>
					<dfn><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></dfn> style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a mark-up language.<br>
					<dfn><abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></dfn> a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other mark-up languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
				</p>
					<div class="box1">
						Boxes
						<div class="box2">
							Boxes
							<div class="box3">
								Boxes
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				<p>
					A web page can be divided into lots of boxes. Any thing or shape on a page is surrounded by a box. Smaller boxes fit into large and larger box until you reach the root of the tree being the web page.<br>The structure of the page would follow these defined boxes and be divided into sections of code, usually achieved with the use of the &lt;div&gt; tag. In the code these sections are indented to show nested sections.
				</p>

			<h3>Lesson 3: Adding CSS style to HTML Structure</h3>

			<p>
				When coding it is useful to reuse code as much as possiable.<br>
				The advantage is that there is less chance of an error occuring if you enter the code once instead of mulitply times.<br>
				Correcting or finding errors is easier because the code is in one place.<br>
				CSS is a good example as the "style" or code can be reused in many different parts of a HTML document.
			</p>
			
			<span class="note">Don't repeat yourself</span>

			<p>
				Cascading refers to the inheritance of the rule or style with the most specific rule been applied.<br>
				CSS uses <em>selectors</em> to define a style. This can be a tag type or a defined class.<br>
				Example p{ } or .description{ }. The attributes are then defined inside the brackets.<br>
				A <em>declaration</em> is property and has a set value.<br>
			</p>
			CSS can be linked into a HTML document in 3 ways:
			<ul>
				<li>Referenced css file</li>
				<li>In the Head of the document</li>
				<li>in-line with html code</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="note">Code - Test - Refine </span>
